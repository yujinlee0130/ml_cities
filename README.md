# Machine Learning Project to Influence NYC Housing Policy

The repository contains a project on creating a machine learning algorithm to predict the loss of rent-stabilized units in New York City buildings. The input data for this problem includes several NYC-wide datasets that give us various building-level information for given years, as well as census datasets that provide additional demographic and socioeconomic information about the areas where buildings are located. The model uses a variety of regression algorithms to predict the loss of rent-stabilized units  where the target variable is a continuous variable representing the change in the share of rent-stabilized units per building, using data from the years 2019 and afterwards.
